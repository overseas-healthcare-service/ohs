#
#   Let's ask the user for their address. Discuss: https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/addresses
#   This (Apply) user journey is aimed at UK residents.
#   however, they may already be living abroad (to study, work, retire, etc). Their address may not be UK format. 
#   Which input style to use? Free text field, or multiple lines?
#   For now, because we need to use address elements to validate identity I will use multiple fields.
#   Assumption is: * We need accurate address elements to validate identity more accurately, and, asumption, most users will be UK resident. *
#
#   nb: Washington team advised us they want "address of current residence" whether uk or abroad doesnt matter.
